# 波茨坦公告
> 1945年7月26日    

美、英、中三国政府领袖公告：

（一）余等：美国总统、中国国民政府主席及英国首相代表余等亿万国民，业经会商，并同意对日本应予以一机会，以结束此次战事。

We-the President of the United States, the President of the National Government of the Republic of China, and the Prime Minister of Great Britain, representing the hundreds of millions of our countrymen, have conferred and agree that Japan shall be given an opportunity to end this war.

（二）美国、英帝国及中国之庞大陆、海、军部队，业已增强多倍，其由西方调来之军队及空军，即将予日本以最后之打击，彼等之武力受所有联合国之决心之支持及鼓励，对日作战，不至其停止抵抗不止。

The prodigious land, sea and air forces of the United States, the British Empire and of China, many times reinforced by their armies and air fleets from the west, are poised to strike the final blows upon Japan. This military power is sustained and inspired by the determination of all the Allied Nations to prosecute the war against Japan until she ceases to resist.

（三）德国无效果及无意识抵抗全世界激起之自由人之力量，所得之结果，彰彰在前，可为日本人民之殷鉴。此种力量当其对付抵抗之纳粹 时不得不将德国人民全体之土地、工业及其生活方式摧残殆尽。但现在集中对待日本之星则较之更为庞大，不可衡量。吾等之军力，加以吾人之坚决意志为后盾，若予以全部实施，必将使日本军队完全毁灭，无可逃避，而日本之本土亦必终归全部残毁。

The result of the futile and senseless German resistance to the might of the aroused free peoples of the world stands forth in awful clarity as an example to the people of Japan. The might that now converges on Japan is immeasurably greater than that which, when applied to the resisting Nazis, necessarily laid waste to the lands, the industry and the method of life of the whole German people. The full application of our military power, backed by our resolve, will mean the inevitable and complete destruction of the Japanese armed forces and just as inevitably the utter devastation of the Japanese homeland.

（四）现时业已到来，日本必须决定一途，其将继续受其一意孤行计算错误，使日本帝国已陷于完全毁灭之境之军人之统制，抑或走向理智之路。

The time has come for Japan to decide whether she will continue to be controlled by those self-willed militaristic advisers whose unintelligent calculations have brought the Empire of Japan to the threshold of annihilation, or whether she will follow the path of reason.

（五）以下为吾人之条件，吾人决不更改，亦无其他另一方式。犹豫迁延，更为吾人所不容许。

Following are our terms. We will not deviate from them. There are no alternatives. We shall brook no delay.

（六）欺骗及错误领导日本人民使其妄欲征服世界者之威权及势力，必须永久剔除。盖吾人坚持非将负责之穷兵黩武主义驱出世界，则和平安全及正义之新秩序势不可能。

There must be eliminated for all time the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest, for we insist that a new order of peace, security and justice will be impossible until irresponsible militarism is driven from the world.

（七）直至如此之新秩序成立时，及直至日本制造战争之力量业已毁灭，有确定可信之证据时，日本领土经盟国之指定，必须占领，俾吾人在此陈述之基本目的得以完成。

Until such a new order is established and until there is convincing proof that Japan's war-making power is destroyed, points in Japanese territory to be designated by the Allies shall be occupied to secure the achievement of the basic objectives we are here setting forth.

（八）开罗宣言之条件必将实施，而日本之主权必将限于本州、北海道、九州、四国及吾人所决定其他小岛之内。

The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out and Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine.

（九）日本军队在完全解除武装以后，将被允许返其家乡，得有和平及生产生活之机会。

The Japanese military forces, after being completely disarmed, shall be permitted to return to their homes with the opportunity to lead peaceful and productive lives.

（十）吾人无意奴役日本民族或消灭其国家，但对于战罪人犯，包括虐待吾人俘虏在内，将处以法律之裁判，日本政府必将阻止日本人民民主趋势之复兴及增强之所有障碍予以消除，言论、宗教及思想自由以及对于基本人权之重视必须成立。

We do not intend that the Japanese shall be enslaved as a race or destroyed as a nation, but stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners. The Japanese Government shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. Freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be established.

（十一）日本将被允许维持其经济所必须及可以偿付货物赔款之工业，但可以使其获得原料，以别于统制原料，日本最后参加国际贸易关系当可准许。

Japan shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those which would enable her to re-arm for war. To this end, access to, as distinguished from control of, raw materials shall be permitted. Eventual Japanese participation in world trade relations shall be permitted.

（十二）上述目的达到及依据日本人民自由表示之意志成立一倾向和平及负责之政府后，同盟国占领军队当撤退。

The occupying forces of the Allies shall be withdrawn from Japan as soon as these objectives have been accomplished and there has been established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people a peacefully inclined and responsible government.

（十三）吾人通告日本政府立即宣布所有日本武装部队无条件投降，并以此种行动诚意实行予以适当之各项保证，除此一途，日本即将迅速完全毁灭。

We call upon the government of Japan to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of all Japanese armed forces, and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action. The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction.
